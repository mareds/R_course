#### Technical infos

The entire course including this website was written in R Markdown. For the lecture presentations I used the [slidify](http://slidify.org/index.html) framework.


#### Course inspiration

Much inspiration for this course was drawn from 

- Hadley Whickam & Garrett Grolemund and their *R for Data Science* Book
- the **Education** sessions at the useR! 2016 and useR! 2017 conferences
- the **purrr** tutorial given by Charlotte Whickam at useR! 2017 
- other great R Markdown websites offering university online courses with the same format such as 
    - https://uoftcoders.github.io/rcourse/index.html
    - https://cmerow.github.io/RDataScience/index.html
    - and particularly https://lsru.github.io/tv_course/index.html
